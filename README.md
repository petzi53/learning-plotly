# Learning Plotly

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of
[Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and
shiny](https://plotly-r.com/) by Carson Sievert. I am using mainly the
more informative online version instead of the [printed version of the
book](https://www.routledge.com/Interactive-Web-Based-Data-Visualization-with-R-plotly-and-shiny/Sievert/p/book/9781138331457).

WATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore
neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.

I wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.
Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.

I am primarily interested in creating interactive maps. I will therefore
stop my notes (for the moment) after finishing chapter 4 of the plotly
book.
